## business logic
- handle spreadsheets and pdfs, compare different pipeline processing methods

## test parsing

- goal is to get blocks of continuous content as accurately as possible
- realising that in between each processed block NaN values represent spacing
- so we can construct an algorithm to find boundaries and then extract them
- **assumption**: there are subtables with and without header

## main flow
- python3 quick-poc.py

## visualize parsing results
- streamlit run simple-rag/parsing_sample_code/streamlit_app.py
